I tried to make a parser but there are problems

the first is the readfile only seems to import one line

the second is that the splitting and the java loops seem to cause problems .

they are breaking the strings up into a string for every character.  when these are printed they give every character space.

i also need to go back to the explanation and see what is left to do for this.

go over the whole thing and see what is expected for the input and output and format of the program.

i could look into hosting it on a server  because this will be work towards my webtech stuff.
