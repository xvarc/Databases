/* run board

improve the text

split the commands so that it promts twice for input

change it so that when it prints it x for 1 and 0 for 2

to stop repeats i can have an array of already inputted characters in my player class and then refuse inputs that have been previously done.

follow my diagram and make it oop . use enums. look at others.

he said that the board class should not have input or output. does that mean that display should be elsewhere?

when i print i can use enumerated types

lots of comments - put title and name into each.

private fields except for immutable objects

defensive programming

lack of dpeendancy cycles

check tools he offers
